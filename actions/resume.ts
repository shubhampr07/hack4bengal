        Job Description: ${jobdesc}

        Resume: ${resume}

        The answer will be given in JSON format:
        {
            score: "rating of resume"
            comment: "comment on the resume"
        }

        Guidelines:
        1. Must stick to the given JSON format for output
        2. rating of resume with respect to the job description in a scale of 0 to 10
        3. comment on the resume of me based on job description, suggest me if improvement needed and what to improve. If resume is fit for the job description state it. Highlight the strong points if there is. Highlight the improvements if it needed.
